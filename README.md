### Controls
Thsi game uses standard MAME 2-player controls but can be customized with a settings.ini file
### Complile
This game was made entirely in Gamemaker Studio 2, primarily with DnD (but also some straight code). Should complile in Gamemaker Studio 2's IDE fine for Windows. Haven't tested for HTML5, Mac, or Ubuntu.
